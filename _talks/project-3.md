               <p style='margin: 10px 0; line-height: 1.6; color: #34495e; font-size: 14px;'>Crime is the most chattered topic in recent days and its prevention is necessary. The essence of machine learning is to analyze data and extract useful information. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention. Natural language processing, and deep learning algorithms used in this field also perform well. Data provides useful information to detect crime patterns. The  aim of this paper is to build  different  crime  prediction  models,  compare and analyze the results of the models. We applied machine learning techniques on Chicago crime dataset (2005-2017). Models predicts the primary crime type depending on some other features. Analyzing the results we visualize how accurately the machine learning models work. Model evaluation techniques are used to choose the best model and how well the models will perform in future. The soul purpose of this research work is to give the best idea of how machine learning can be used by the law enforcement agencies to detect, predict and solve crimes at a much faster rate. </p>
