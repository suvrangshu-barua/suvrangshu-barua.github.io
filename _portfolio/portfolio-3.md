               <p style='margin: 5px 0;'>Fight For World is a post-apocalyptic action game where players take on the role of a sci-fi soldier fighting through toxic environments filled with radioactive creatures. Players engage in intense combat using various weapons, strategically deploy turrets for defense, and upgrade their soldierâ€™s stats and equipment with collected coins and radiation tokens. The game features challenging boss battles and a unique area liberation mechanic, where players cleanse radiation zones by defeating enemies and destroying their nests. The gameplay blends fast-paced action with strategic decision-making to deliver an immersive and engaging experience.</p>
