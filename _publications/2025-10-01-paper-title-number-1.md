excerpt: 'As video games have gradually become more immersive and impactful on players emotions, it is quite important to know and address how players' unique experiences can influence the perception of difficult topics like heartbreak and depression. This study investigates how does closure from past relationships influence players' emotional responses while playing Sayonara Wild Hearts. The research employes extensive gameplay analysis including repeated playthroughs to construct interpretations of the chapters, levels and thematic contents. This was followed by examining online blogs, articles and research works regarding breakup, depression, closure, pop music, and music as a therapeutic medium to draw literature references. Additional findings were drawn from essay videos and posts from dedicated online communities. Empirical validation was obtained through conducting online survey, examining the relationship between closure and gameplay experience. The findings indicate that the participants who achieved closure from past relationships tend to experience the game as an affirmation of self-love. In contrast, players who continue to grapple with unattended emotional baggage often experience the game as a form of catharsis to confront their negative emotions.'
